In the main program, 5 sample employee objects are generated using a List, added to the collection, and their details (name, position, salary, age) are printed to the console.
<p> /oopConcept --> This code defines a Computer class, creates 5 computer objects with unique IP addresses using a loop, stores them in a list, and prints their details to the console.</>
<p> /oopStudents --> This code manages students by assigning random grades and IDs. It creates 5 students, calculates the average, removes a student from the list, and 
uses LINQ to sort and display the results.</>
<p>/randomGuessGame --> app creates a random int and asks users to guess the number</>
<p>/salaryAvgWLinq --> This program manages employee and manager objects in a single list using inheritance and polymorphism, applying a custom raise algorithm that includes a specific bonus for managers.</>
<p> /triangleInequality --> asks user to enter 3 numbers for a triangle and calculates if the triangle is possible to made</>
<p>factorial.cs --> calculates factorial with for and while loop</p>
<p>fibonacci.cs -->calculates fibonacci numbers</p>
<p>leibnizPi.cs --> calculates pi with Leibniz formula</p>
<p>primeNumbers.cs--> takes a number from user and tells if the number is prime or not</p>
<p> randomGuessName.cs --> app creates a random int and asks users to guess the number </>
<p>triangleInequality.cs --> asks user to enter 3 numbers for a triangle and calculates if the triangle is possible to made</>
